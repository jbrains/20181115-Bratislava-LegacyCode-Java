# How to Build Trivia

I tried to find the "lowest" versions of Maven and Java that I could use to build this project, choosing from versions of Maven and Java that I could easily install using `sdkman`.

- OpenJDK Java 7.0-191
- Maven 3.3.9

On these versions, I could successfully build the project and run the tests.
