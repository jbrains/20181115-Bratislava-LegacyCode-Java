# How to Build Trivia

I tried to find the "lowest" versions of Maven and Java that I could use to build this project, choosing from versions of Maven and Java that I could easily install using `sdkman`.

- OpenJDK Java 7.0-191
- Maven 3.3.9

On these versions, I could successfully build the project and run the tests.

From here, I tried to find the most-recent version of Maven and Java that would work together.

**I could build this project with these combinations of Java and Maven.**

| Java           | Maven |
| -------------- | ----- |
| OpenJDK 10.0.2 | 3.3.9 |
| OpenJDK 10.0.2 | 3.6.0 |
